# ARIMA Time Series Model Simulator

Use the website [here](https://zhangwy324.github.io/arima-sim-fe/)!

**Note:** Backend server and API is deployed on Railway. The backend may be down because I cannot afford to keep it up running 24/7 :(

---

**Tech Stack:**

- Frontend: React with Vite, Chart.js

- Server: Express.js deployed on Railway

- API: Plumber API written in R deployed using Docker on Railway


**Todo:** 

- Will better design the website. I know it's ugly. 

- Will add more features: better error handling and input validation, more statistics (ACF plot?), export data, etc...
